## Colophon ##
This font is an offspring of Rachana movement under the leadership of 
R. Chitrajakumar who founded Rachana Akshara Vedi in 1999. He devised the
‘definitive character set’ of Malayalam based on traditional script which is
the base of Rachana as well as this font.

The naming convention of glyphs (`k1` for `ക`, `k2` for `ഖ` etc.) is devised
by K.H. Hussain in 2005 to form a mnemonic way to represent conjuncts and its
components and to facilitate the coding of glyph substitution of conjuncts.
